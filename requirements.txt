# Claude Memory Dependencies
# ==========================

# Core dependencies (always required)
# None - uses Python standard library (sqlite3, json, etc.)

# Optional: Semantic search with local embeddings
# Install for air-gapped vector similarity search
# First embedding generation downloads ~500MB model (cached thereafter)
fastembed>=0.3.0      # Local ONNX-based text embeddings
hnswlib>=0.8.0        # Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search
numpy>=1.24.0         # Required by fastembed and hnswlib

# Development dependencies (for testing)
# pytest>=7.0.0       # Uncomment for development
